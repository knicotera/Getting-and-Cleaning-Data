# Course Project 1: Getting and Cleaning Data

Author: Kevin Nicotera

# Project Description 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. This project deals with data collected from the accelerometers of the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The overall purpose is to collect, transform, and clean the data.

# Summary

This script (run_analysis.R) enables the user to collect, work with, and export a clean a data set by following the guidelines below:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
